# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from Luke's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql) and is limited to 2023. It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my
SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data
analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher
salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the Indian data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating
specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analysts Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered
data analyst positions by average yearly salary
and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query
highlights the high paying opportunities in the
field.
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id    
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location LIKE '_%India%' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC    
LIMIT 10    
```

### 2. Top Demand Skills
To understand what skills are in demand, i joined the job posting with the skills data to get our demand trends
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
JOIN 
    skills_job_dim on skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
JOIN 
    skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location LIKE '_%India%'   
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC     
LIMIT 5       
```

### 3. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top paying jobs, i joined the job posting with the skills data 
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS
(
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        company_dim.name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id    
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location LIKE '_%India%' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC    
    LIMIT 10   
) 

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills 
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
JOIN 
    skills_job_dim on skills_job_dim.job_id = top_paying_jobs.job_id
JOIN 
    skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
```

### 4. The Most Optimal Skills
This is all about maximising benefits to looks at skills that are in demand as well as of great value.
```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skilLs_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg)) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
JOIN 
    skills_job_dim on skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
JOIN 
    skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND job_location LIKE '_%India%' 
    AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC, 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25
```
